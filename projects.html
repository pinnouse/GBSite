      <h4>Sgnow</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>
          Sgnow (pronounced 'snow') is a quick and efficient music player written in Rust and NodeJS.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          Create a beautiful music player that's customizable and extensible
          with a small memory footprint. Of course the irony is using
          <a href="https://electronjs.org">electron</a> for the frontend, but there are
          no native alternatives otherwise that offer such a high degree of
          accessibility.

      <h4>Zero Two Bot</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>
          Discord bot made with ðŸ’–.
          Includes an AI chatbot and hosted 24/7.
          The core bot was written in <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to create a production ready service that I personally loved
          (both the character and the project itself). I try to use best
          practices and deployment solutions to create a top notch niche
          project. This is one of my proudest feats because of its functionality
          and the experience I've gained.

          Website for Unionville High School's Robotics Club.
          Has vector graphics inspired by Kurzgesagt.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          Create a public face for the club with the goal of attracting
          potential sponsors and partners. I wanted to really capture
          the uniqueness of our club and an SPA-like website sounded
          appealing.

        <p>
          A personal project for fun to try out some web design built from the
          base up.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to try my hand at web design whilst keeping the product
          within my interests and supporting group I love. Through this, I
          unintendingly learned to create web sockets to interact with the
          Twitch API and host a web socket server.

          A project that I worked with a partner with. This was a two part
          project.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          Well it was a school project and I just wanted to work on something
          with my friend. I was able to flex my web design skills while
          maintaining a modern, usable interface.

        <p>
          These two projects were created in tandem when I was first getting

        </p>
        <h5>Reina Bot</h5>
        <p>
          Reina Bot was my first full attempt at pushing a Discord bot into
          production. The working bot is the <a href="#zerotwo">zero two bot</a>
          as seen above.
        </p>
        <h5>Reina Chat</h5>
        <p>
          Reina Chat is my currently in use service for the AI chatbot my
          Discord bots use. This was my attempt at learning Machine
          Learning/Artificial Intelligence.
