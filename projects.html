      <h4>Sgnow</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>
          Sgnow (pronounced 'snow') is a quick and efficient music player written in C++ and SDL.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to build a very efficient and lightweight music player.
          I was hoping to solve the need for a beautiful, customizable, and lightning quick player that felt modern and friendly.

      <h4>Zero Two Bot</h4>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>
          Discord bot made with ðŸ’–.
          Includes an AI chatbot and hosted 24/7.
          The core bot was written in <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to create a production ready service that I personally loved (both the character and the project itself).
          I try to use best practices and deployment solutions to create a top notch niche project.
          This is one of my proudest feats because of its functionality and the experience I've gained.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>
          A personal project for fun to try out some web design built from the base up.
        </p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to try my hand at web design whilst keeping the product within my interests and supporting group I love.
          Through this, I unintendingly learned to create web sockets to interact with the Twitch API and host a web socket server.

        <p>
          Well it was a school project and I just wanted to work on something with my friend.

        <p>
          Reina Chat is my currently in use service for the AI chatbot my Discord bots use. This was my attempt at learning Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.
